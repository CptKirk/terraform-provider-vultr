# vultr_bare_metal_server

Provides a Vultr bare metal server resource. This can be used to create, read, modify, and delete bare metal servers on your Vultr account.

## Example Usage

Create a new bare metal server:

```hcl
resource "vultr_bare_metal_server" "my_server" {
	plan_id = "100"
	region_id = "40"
	os_id = "270"
}
```

Create a new bare metal server with options:

```hcl
resource "vultr_bare_metal_server" "my_server" {
	plan_id = "100"
	region_id = "40"
	os_id = "270"
	label = "my-server-label"
	tag = "my-server-tag"
	hostname = "my-server-hostname"
	user_data = "{'foo': true}"
	enable_ipv6 = true
	notify_activate = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region_id` - (Required) The ID of the region that the server is to be created in.
* `plan_id` - (Required) The ID of the plan that you want the server to subscribe to.
* `os_id` - (Optional) The ID of the operating system to be installed on the server.
* `app_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Vultr application to be installed on the server.
* `snapshot_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Vultr snapshot that the server will restore for the initial installation. 
* `script_id` - (Optional) The ID of the startup script you want added to the server.
* `ssh_key_ids` - (Optional) A list of SSH key IDs to apply to the server on install (only valid for Linux/FreeBSD).
* `user_data` - (Optional) Generic data store, which some provisioning tools and cloud operating systems use as a configuration file. It is generally consumed only once after an instance has been launched, but individual needs may vary.
* `enable_ipv6` - (Optional) Whether the server has IPv6 networking activated.
* `notify_activate` - (Optional) Whether an activation email will be sent when the server is ready.
* `hostname` - (Optional) The hostname to assign to the server.
